# GoogleForm_Automation
Selenium Web Automation for Google Forms Submission

This repository contains a Python-based Selenium script that automates the process of filling out and submitting a Google Form. The script interacts with a Google Form to input data into various fields like Name, Contact Number, Email, Address, Pincode, Date of Birth, Gender, and Type. It also demonstrates the usage of various Selenium features such as waiting for elements, interacting with dynamic content, and automating form submission.

Features:

1.Automates Google Forms Submission: Automatically fills and submits the Google Form with predefined data.

2.WebDriver Waits: Uses WebDriverWait and expected_conditions for robust interaction with dynamically loaded elements.

3.Cross-Browser Compatibility: Works with Chrome WebDriver (can be extended to other browsers like Firefox, Edge).

4.Handles Various Input Types: Simulates typing in text fields, selecting options, and submitting the form.

5.Date Picker Handling: Demonstrates how to handle date input fields with the correct format.

Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need the following:

1.Python: Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. You can download it from here.

2.Selenium: Selenium WebDriver is required for automating the browser. Install it using

pip install selenium

3.ChromeDriver: Download the appropriate ChromeDriver version that matches your Chrome browser from ChromeDriver downloads.

4.Google Chrome: Ensure that you have the latest version of Google Chrome installed on your machine.

Setup:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/viveksingh052/GoogleForm_Automation.git

2.Install the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Download and place the ChromeDriver executable in the appropriate path as referenced in the script (or update the script with your local path).

4.Run the script using Python:
python automation_script.py

Code Walkthrough:
Selenium WebDriver Setup: Initializes the Chrome WebDriver and navigates to the Google Form URL.
Wait Mechanism: Uses WebDriverWait for waiting until elements become clickable or visible, ensuring the script interacts with elements only after they are ready.
Filling Form Fields: The script locates form fields using XPath and CSS selectors, fills them with sample data (Name, Email, Address, etc.), and submits the form.
Handling Date Field: Demonstrates how to interact with date fields using the send_keys() method to input the date in the required format (yyyy-mm-dd).


Future Enhancements
Add support for different browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).
Integrate CAPTCHA solving or use services like 2Captcha to handle CAPTCHA challenges in the form.
Implement error handling for better robustness (e.g., handling network failures or page load issues).
Make the form data dynamic and allow for input from external sources such as CSV, Excel, or databases.

Acknowledgments
Selenium WebDriver: For automating the browser interactions.
Google Forms: For providing an easy way to create and collect data via forms.
Python: For being an easy-to-learn language suitable for scripting and automation.
